### Use I4-DLU (IPv4 DNS Lookup Utility): Link will be available soon



The ipv4LKUP batch script is a simple tool that allows users to input a URL and obtain its corresponding IPv4 address. The script utilizes PowerShell commands within a batch script to perform DNS resolution and fetch the IPv4 address associated with the provided URL.

**Usage:**

Run the batch script (ipv4LKUP.bat).

Enter the URL when prompted.

The script will display the IPv4 address associated with the entered URL, if successfully resolved.

**Note:**

The script relies on network connectivity and DNS resolution capabilities.

In case of failure to resolve the URL to an IPv4 address, an appropriate error message will be displayed.
